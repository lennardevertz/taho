// We want to add Sepolia to the list of Alchemy-supported chains. This will
// allow the extension to fill the list of historical transactions on that
// chain.
// We can't just add `SEPOLIA` to `ALCHEMY_SUPPORTED_CHAIN_IDS` because the
// `@ethersproject/providers@5.7.2` package that we use as a project dependency
// does not support Sepolia yet (no `sepolia` case in the `getUrl` function of
// `./src.ts/alchemy-provider.ts`). The support is planned to be added in the
// upcoming patch, but as it's release date is unknown, we're adding the Sepolia
// support by creating `TahoAlchemyProvider` class that handles this case.
// In the future we may want to add there another case, for `arbitrum-sepolia`,
// but we can't do that at this moment, as Alchemy does not offer an RPC for
// Arbitrum Sepolia yet.
